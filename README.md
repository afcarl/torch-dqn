## Grid World DQN using torch7

This is a naive DQN example implemented in torch7 to help future research.

The environment is based on [rlenvs](https://github.com/Kaixhin/rlenvs) of [Kaixhin](https://github.com/Kaixhin) and the model makes use of "Increasing the Action Gap" ([http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04860](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04860)).
